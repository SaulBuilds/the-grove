# Agentile Framework Spirit

## Living Interpretation of Rules

While the SOUL.md contains immutable principles, the SPIRIT.md represents the living, evolving interpretation of how those principles are enacted in a specific community, project, or set of rules. The spirit emerges from shared practice and can evolve through consensus.

### The Spirit Follows the Soul

The spirit interprets and applies the soul's principles to concrete contexts:
- **Authenticity Over Appearance** becomes: "We reject implementations that satisfy tests but lack real data flows"
- **Community as Interpreter** becomes: "We hold weekly interpretation sessions to align on rule meanings"
- **Continuous Alignment** becomes: "We use the correction protocol at every sprint boundary"
- **Embrace of Paradox** becomes: "We document where our interpretations diverge from rule letters"
- **Language Games Awareness** becomes: "We explicitly define our acceptance criteria language games"

## Consensus-Based Evolution

The spirit evolves through a structured consensus process that requires multiple signatures, ensuring changes reflect genuine community agreement rather than individual interpretation.

### Amendment Process

1. **Proposal**: Any community member can propose a change to the spirit
2. **Discussion**: The proposal is discussed in community forums (meetings, threads, etc.)
3. **Trial Period**: The proposed change is tried for a defined period (typically 1-2 sprints)
4. **Sign-off Collection**: During the trial period, community members can sign their agreement
5. **Threshold**: The change becomes part of the spirit when it receives signatures from:
   - 60% of active core contributors
   - 80% of maintainers
   - Unanimous agreement from project architects (if applicable)
6. **Review**: After adoption, the change is reviewed at the next retrospective

### Signature Requirements

Signatures must include:
- Name/identifier
- Date
- Brief rationale for agreement
- Any concerns or conditions

## Relationship to SOUL.md

- **SOUL.md** is the unchanging foundation (like a constitution)
- **SPIRIT.md** is the living interpretation (like constitutional law and precedent)
- The spirit must always be compatible with the soul - no spirit change can violate soul principles
- When in doubt, the soul overrides the spirit

## Implementation in Agentile Framework

In the Agentile framework, the spirit is manifested through:

1. **JOURNAL_RULES.md**: Requires asking user perspective at sprint boundaries (community correction)
2. **AGENT_ENTRY.md**: New agents must read and agree to current spirit
3. **Workflow Templates**: Each workflow (FEATURE.md, SPRINT.md, etc.) includes spirit alignment checks
4. **Zooid Definitions**: Role-specific interpretations of the spirit (DEVELOPER.md, ARCHITECT.md, etc.)
5. **Audit Processes**: Regular checks for spirit compliance

## Example Spirit Entries

These would be community-specific interpretations:

### For a Financial Trading System
- "Authenticity means: All pricing algorithms must connect to live market data feeds during trading hours"
- "Community interpretation: We consider a 5-minute data delay acceptable during high volatility periods"
- "Alignment practice: Daily 15-minute market data validation sessions"

### For an Open Source Project
- "Authenticity means: Documentation must match actual API behavior, not intended behavior"
- "Community interpretation: We accept community-contributed documentation that improves clarity"
- "Alignment practice: Monthly documentation sprints paired with code reviews"

### For an Internal Tool
- "Authenticity means: The tool must reduce actual toil, not just create the appearance of efficiency"
- "Community interpretation: We measure success by hours saved per week per user"
- "Alignment practice: Quarterly time-tracking studies with user interviews"

## CI/CD Integration

The spirit can be implemented in CI/CD pipelines as:

1. **Pre-commit hooks**: Check for obvious violations of current spirit
2. **PR validation**: Require spirit alignment checklists in pull requests
3. **Pipeline gates**: Block deployment if spirit compliance tests fail
4. **Dashboard metrics**: Track spirit adherence over time
5. **Automated suggestions**: Recommend spirit-consistent alternatives

## The Amendment Pipeline

A technical implementation might look like:

```
[Proposal] → [Discussion Thread] → [Trial Branch] → 
[Signature Collection] → [Threshold Check] → [Main Merge] → 
[Pipeline Update] → [Agent Retraining]
```

Each stage requires specific approvals and validations before progressing.

## Maintenance

- The spirit should be reviewed quarterly for relevance
- Obsolete spirit entries should be archived, not deleted
- Major soul revisions require spirit reconciliation
- New communities inheriting the framework should adopt and adapt the spirit
