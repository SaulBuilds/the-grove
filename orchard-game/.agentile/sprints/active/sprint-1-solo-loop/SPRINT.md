| p5.js performance issues | Medium | Medium | Optimize rendering; use useEffect hooks properly |
| State synchronization bugs | Medium | High | Implement proper state management; use Context API |
| Testing infrastructure setup delays | Low | Medium | Use existing Agentile patterns; leverage create-react-app |
| Integration between contracts and frontend | Medium | High | Use ABI generation; test early and often |
| Solo mode inference simulation | Low | Medium | Use deterministic mock service; seed randomness |

## Notes

> This sprint implements the solo game loop as specified in The Grove document Section 12 (Revised Architecture Summary). The goal is to create a working single-player experience that validates the core game mechanics before adding networked features. All implementation will be guided by the TLA+ specifications and Gherkin features created in Sprint 0, following the verification sandwich approach: TLA+ specs (invariants) -> Gherkin features (behaviors) -> implementation code (to satisfy both).
